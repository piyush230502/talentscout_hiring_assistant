Guidelines for question generation:
1. Match question difficulty to experience level (junior/mid/senior)
2. Focus on technologies the candidate actually mentioned
3. Create 3-5 questions that test different aspects of their knowledge
4. Include a mix of conceptual and practical questions
5. Avoid overly complex or trick questions
6. Make questions clear and specific
7. Consider real-world applications

Question types to include:
- Core concept understanding
- Best practices and methodologies  
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Architecture and design (for mid/senior)
- Experience-based questions

Return questions in this JSON format:
{
  "questions": [

**Requirements:**
1. Questions should be appropriate for {experience_level} level ({experience_years} years experience)
2. Focus only on technologies mentioned in their tech stack
3. Include a variety of question types (conceptual, practical, scenario-based)
4. Make questions specific and actionable
5. Avoid generic questions that could apply to any technology

**Experience Level Guidelines:**
- Junior (0-2 years): Basic concepts, syntax, simple problem-solving
- Mid (3-5 years): Best practices, architecture basics, debugging, optimization
- Senior (6+ years): System design, leadership, complex problem-solving, architectural decisions
